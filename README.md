# Microprocessor systems - project
This was a 2016. project for a course in microprocessor systems.
The goal was to create a device that measured and displayed temperature in an adjustable format, using an ARM board and some I/O components.
There was no IDE support and no hardware-specific libraries were used for
communication between the board and the I/O devices. Instead, the protocols
([IÂ²C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%C2%B2C), [1-Wire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1-Wire), etc.)
were implemented from scratch using the hardware specs included in [here](docs/Hardware_datasheets/).

For a detailed explanation and specific information take a look at the provided documentation
([EN](docs/Documentation_EN.pdf)/[RS](docs/Dokumentacija_RS.pdf)).
